# SnapLensStudio-CodeSnippets
Useful stand-alone code snippets.

To use, simply add the script to your scene. Then call the function as described at the top of the script in the comments.<br/>
This can be done from any other script in the scene.

Will update every once in a while, and for more code help check out LSQuickScripts!<br/>
A big collection of ready-to-use functions:
