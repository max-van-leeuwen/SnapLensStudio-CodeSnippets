# SnapLensStudio-CodeSnippets
Handy code, will update every once in a while.

To use, simply add the script to your scene.<br/>
Call the function as described at the top of the script in the comments.<br/>
This can be done from any script in the scene.

All scripts have a simple example project showing how they work!<br/><br/><br/>

Contents:
- LSQuickScripts
  - My 'cheatsheet' collection of code snippets. I always have this in every project I do :)
- Mesh Copy
  - Read all the vertex information of a mesh, and rebuild the mesh using MeshBuilder.
- MeshBuilder Plane Generator
  - Generate a plane of custom density using MeshBuilder.
- Simple SDF Collisions Update
